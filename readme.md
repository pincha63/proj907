Following the lead of:

https://mrcook.uk/static-websites-with-roda-framework

Also:
1. https://mrcook.uk/simple-roda-blog-tutorial ... probably this one will be used as reference for the next project
2. https://roda.jeremyevans.net/ and https://roda.jeremyevans.net/documentation.html ... the definitive reference
3. https://fiachetti.gitlab.io/mastering-roda/ ... the book... I find it hard to read unless you already know stuff
4. https://www.kdobson.net/2019/ruby-roda-guide-1/ ... not actually following anything from here
